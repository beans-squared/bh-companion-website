# Type
0 = Beginning (green)
These games are relatively simple to understand and/or encourages the players to explore different parts of the arena. This is useful to help players “warm up” with a simple game where they will hopefully be allowed to explore the arena and get used to their guns if they are new.

1 = Middle (yellow)
This is the largest section and contains all games that can be played between the first and last game played. When choosing games for the middle of a session you should try and find a game that utilizes a prop that has not been used yet and will not be used later during that session.

2 = End (red)
These are games that help us control the timing of the game so that we can end our sessions on time without having to play team deathmatch at the end of every session. The majority of these games will be games with neutral objectives (both teams are attacking). 

3 = In-between (blue)
These are games that can be easier to set up and watch as a single FM since there is usually only one running a group in-between sessions. Many “End” games can also be played in-between battles since we can end the game once the new group joins the session.
